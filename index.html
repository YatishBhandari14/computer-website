The school aims at the holistic development of students providing state of the art education. We aim at inculcating values of honesty, integrity, leadership, self confidence, tolerance and spirit of sportsmanship in little minds. The tiny tots are encouraged to develop a bond of humanism with an inquisitive temperament. The school environment provides ample opportunity to imbibe true values of the school motto. Education cultivates the right attitude and teaches the students to be humble and strive to prove that they are the worthy citizens of the Nation.

Education, in the Yatish Public environment nurtures the young impressionable minds to mould into healthy blossoms of tomorrow
